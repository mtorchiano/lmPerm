# lmPerm
Permutation Tests for Linear Models

This is the original package developed by Bob Wheeler that I took over after his sad demise.

I just maintain the package and keep it up-to-date with CRAN standards and rules.

The package is available on the CRAN web site: 
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lmPerm

In case you wish using a version not yet on the CRAN web site you can use the `devtools` package:

```r
install.packages("devtools")  ## if not already installed
devtools::install_github("mtorchiano/lmPerm")
```
